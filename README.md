# BypassUAC
A rework of CMLuaUtil AutoElevated 

Original C# version : [0xlane](https://github.com/0xlane/BypassUAC)

## Why ?

The original version does not work anymore because of wrong import' signatures. I added some dinvoke delegates with manual address resolver.

Works for both X86 (wow64) & X64 architecture.
